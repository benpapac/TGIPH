# WELCOME TO TGIPH!

"Thank God I'm Post-Human," is the story of one bot's quest to seek revenge on the humans that made it. As the player lands on the site, they're led to believe that they're signing into a gif search app powered by
[Giphy](https://giphy.com/). Little do they know, that buried in the submit button on the sign-in form is a cunning piece of malware...

A React Link element that takes them into a Gif Bot's insidious game.

Players must successfully complete one of the Gif Bot's challenges: a matching game, where they guess the names of each actor on the screen, or a "common" game, where they guess what film two actors have in common.

Once they succeed, they're returned to the home page, where they may return to finding the perfect gif.

## Description

As I completed Unit 2 of my Software Engineering Immersive with React, I wanted to create an app that both illustrated the foundations of single page applications, and added a fun layer of complexity.

If you spend more than a few seconds on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/benpapac/), you know I love game design, so I threw a little trivia into the mix. The useContext hook allows me to create a set of game state variables, and I then use those variables to control which components the user sees. Once they trigger the game by "signing in," they can only access game levels. Once they've won, and before they fall into the Gif Bot's trap, they can access the gif search app.

## Technologies

Deployment via [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
HTML, Java Script, CSS
React
React Router Dom
Hooks: useState, useEffect, useContext
